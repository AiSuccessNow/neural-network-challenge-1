# **Student Loan Risk Analysis With Deep Learning**

 * Importing dependencies 

 * Data preparation and processing

 * Datasets split to X and y (target) sets

 * Train Test Split separate data into train and test groups

 * Data scaled with Standard Scaler
   * data was scaled, fitted and transformed

 * Compilation and Model Evaluation with Neural Network
   * Dense Layers added:
     *  2 relu hidden layers
     *  1 Tanh hidden layer
     *  Sigmoid Activation layer

## **Next Steps:**
Despite the depth of the analysis, the output result was pathetic. 
Better qaulity student laon data would have improved the performance of the model.
Thanks You :)
